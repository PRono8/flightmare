# Flightmare
 
This is an academic repository to implement the Flightmare simulator into Aerostack.

To run Flightmare and connect it with Aerostack, you need to run the following command:

```
    roslaunch flightros example1_interface.launch
```

In which the simulation environment can be modified by changing the launch ''scene'' parameter.


To add a new scene you have to follow this tutorial
